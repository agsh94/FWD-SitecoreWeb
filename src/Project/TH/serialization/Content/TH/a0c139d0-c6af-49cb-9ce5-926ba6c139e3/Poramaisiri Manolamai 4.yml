        <p><em>As FWD Group CEO, I share a strong passion with my team about changing the way people feel about insurance. I work closely with our leadership team to build FWD into a strong, cohesive business across Asia achieving our unified vision to bring change to the insurance landscape.</em></p>
        <p><em>When FWD was born, we dared to be different and set out to challenge the traditional mind set of our industry. We wanted to create a new kind of insurer with customers where they deserve to be; at the very heart of our business. We believe in making it easy for people to understand and enjoy the benefits of insurance with straightforward products that are relevant to today&rsquo;s lifestyles. In Thailand, the FWD brand has already made great strides towards offering customers a differentiated, fresh experience of insurance, with the ethos of taking care of our customers&rsquo; worries so that they can live their life today with confidence.</em></p>
