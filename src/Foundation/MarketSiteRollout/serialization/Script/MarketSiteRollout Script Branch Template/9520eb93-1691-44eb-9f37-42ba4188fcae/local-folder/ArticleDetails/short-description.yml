      Value: Holidays for others may be staying home and relaxing. But a holiday for people who like coffee, like me, is searching for a café to chill out with good coffee, a pleasant atmosphere, and today is another day that I spent the holidays traveling to One Two Two Coffee Bar. Srinakarin District The newest cafe is opened, with people suggesting that this coffee shop is very delicious.
